# Talent Analytics (ML)
This repository contains machine learning projects I completed on the topic of talent analytics.  
Each project explores different aspects of workforce data using various machine learning methods.

## Project 1: Predicting Employee Churn
I trained a decision tree model on employee data to predict churn, achieving a 0.94 F1 score for identifying leavers. Satisfaction level, monthly hours, and number of projects were top predictors. By focusing on these drivers, an HR can proactively retain at-risk employees with targeted interventions.
